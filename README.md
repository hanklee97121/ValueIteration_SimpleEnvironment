# ValueIteration_SimpleEnvironment
This project is an application of the value iteration from reinforcement learning on a simple environment below.<img width="675" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-02 at 5 14 43 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71743877/166336239-c3e378c8-0b1a-4e24-8064-0fe9bd6edfda.png">
In this environment (diagram above), in each state (box), the person receive reward the number on the box. At each state the person must decide to move upwards or downwards to the next box. We want our algorithm to find the best route (policy) that maximize the total reward. In our notation, 'U' stands for upward, 'D' stands for downward and a path is a combination of four actions (e.g. ['U', 'D', 'U', 'D'] is a path of going upward then downward then upward then downward.)
